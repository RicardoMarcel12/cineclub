test for applaudo studios

version: 0.1

first do a mvn build 
for running use the command mvn spring-boot:run and take note of the password generated 

then you can access the api from localhost:8080/api and login with the username 'user' and the password in the console.
for now theres only one function to get all the users of the App: api/users to get a JSON with the list of users in the Database.
